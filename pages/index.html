    Institutes of Health (<a style="color:#0000FF" href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>), USA. I completed my Ph.D. from the

    at <a style="color:#0000FF" href="https://www.iimb.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Management Bangalore</a>.
    Prior to joining IIMB, I was working as an IT Consultant at
